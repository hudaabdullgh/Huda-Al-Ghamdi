This is a quick explanation about the process and procedures used in analyzing this project. Please check the point below to have a better understanding of what is done:

•	First, I  read the Data present in Drivinglicense.csv using pandas read csv, than removed the two columns because it contains kind binary numeration which is not worthy.
•	Displayed the data of first 10 rows of both traffic and driving.
•	briefly describe about the data you can read it, it's about the type of data.
•	In step 4 I have searched for the missing values and in pandas if the value is missing, we will get NaN value
•	Printed the missing Data.
•	 Printed the minimum and maximum value of the dataset
•	 Here we have to check the datatypes so at the position all the datatypes are string as object.
•	The year should be converted to int and all you can read it.
•	 Here I fixed the data types, and created two new columns x,y. and printed the rows to check
•	whether everything is okay or not. Now datatypes are also fine.
•	 I renamed the columns accordingly.
•	 In this step I have to write the datatypes, datasets and descriptions of every column.
•	 Then I have to write about total regions in saudi and removed the missing.
•	 Checking about the size and width of data it's 325,6
•	 Here I changed the format so that we can merge
•	I merged using outer method, so it will merge automatically by doing union.
•	In this step we have to review it and save it accordingly.
•	than I have to describe the data like mean standard deviation, percentage, time.
•	Calculating standard deviation using the formulae given manually.
•	Showing the data using dictionary comprehension.
•	integrating the Numpy standard methods.
•	I have to calculate everything as mentioned in questions.
•	visualizing the data set using seaborn and generating the heat map.
•	Plotting the histogram according to the functions and fragment it.
•	we have to plot and interpret histogram (Driving license number, Traffic Accidents Number) And two additional histograms for better understanding.
•	I plotted all the 4 scatters mentioned.
•	Now we have to plot the box of the variables which have relative scale (total 5 variables)
Now We have to add some additional plots after doing lot of research
•	I plotted the chart for the traffic accidents v/s regions in 2017 and which region has the highest number of accidents.
•	there are descriptive Ques and Ans. Which I have done by myself you can check it.
•	I have done hypothesis for checking the null value
•	Then Conclusion, which is a recommendation as a data scientist in how would the data be improved or extra information needed to have better analysis.
